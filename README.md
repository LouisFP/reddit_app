## Introduction
Welcome to my CodeCademy-inspired project in which I was tasked to create a simplified version, (a RedditMini if you will), which can search for subreddits,posts,
and comments from Reddit using either the Reddit JSON API or the Reddit API. I hope you find it interesting, it took just over 3 days to complete.

## Technologies used
The technologies used were as follows

+ React- I used this to build components.
+ React-Router-DOM- I used this alongside the reddit API to link to pages and find the necessary variables needed to find each specific post, comment or subreddit
depending on the page.
+ Redux- this was used to store data and utilise methods, most often from the reddit API which were used in asynchronous thunk.
+ CSS - to format the page and (hopefully), provide a better aesthetic to the page

## Features
As briefly desribed above, the app allows you to search for subreddits, then it will show you a list of subreddits. You may then click on one and it will take you to a list of posts on these subreddits. Finally, you may then see the comments on each individual post and see upvotes, author and other important pieces of information.

## Future works
I would probably improve the aesthetic of the project further and add in a sort button, this would sort the subreddits and posts by number of upvotes, or number of comments perhaps. As a result, users could search for the most popular results. Finally, I would add support for embedded images and for videos which, currently, the app doesn't have.
